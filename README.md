# Singer_Recommender_System
This recommendation model helps in recommending singers based on the preferences of the users.

In this recommender system, we are using the concept of model-based collaborative filtering for recommending singers to the users.

The algorithm which is used here for prediction purposes is stochastic gradient descent. It is used because SGD minimizes the 
loss function.

SGD is also used because of its accuracy and swiftness. Moreover, there are numerous deep learning models built using SGD. Therefore,
it can be trusted with the results as well.

Lastly, root mean squared error was used to find out the accuracy of the model. The result of this test was around 28%, this result
suggest that our model is performing well.
